## âœ¨ What We Built

**Tell Lore** is a drag-and-drop canvas for creating _interactive_, _animated_ stories â€” no coding, no animating, just storytelling.

With Tell Lore, you can:

-   Describe each scene in natural language
-   Define choices for the reader to react to
-   Visually connect scenes with branching logic
-   Submit your story and export it to structured JSON
-   Generate fully animated scenes using AI tools like **Pika Labs**
-   Deliver an explorable, cinematic experience â€” as magical as Studio Ghibli

## ðŸ’¡ Why We Built It

Interactive storytelling is powerful â€” it transforms audiences into participants. But creating it traditionally requires:

-   Writing a branching narrative
-   Storyboarding dozens of scenes
-   Animating each one individually
-   Coding transitions and logic

We wanted to change that.

Our mission:  
**Make interactive storytelling as simple as typing a story and connecting the dots.**

Whether you're a teacher, a parent, a writer, or a child â€” you should be able to bring your story to life and let others explore it.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

-   Scenes are created as visual blocks on a canvas
-   Each scene includes:
    -   A title
    -   A description ("scenario")
    -   Two choices
-   Choices can be dragged to connect to the next scene
-   You can edit everything inline, visually
-   When you're done, click **Submit** to export a `story.json` and power your interactive player or AI video pipeline

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

-   **Next.js, React, and TypeScript** â€” frontend
-   **@xyflow/react** (React Flow) â€” interactive graph editor
-   **Pika Labs** â€” AI video generation from scenes
-   **Tailwind CSS** â€” lightweight UI
